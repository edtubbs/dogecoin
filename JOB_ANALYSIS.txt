## URLs Provided
1. First URL: https://github.com/edtubbs/dogecoin/actions/runs/21774780119/job/62829359888?pr=8
2. Second URL: https://github.com/edtubbs/dogecoin/actions/runs/21774780119/job/62829359897#step:5:1369

## Observations
- Same run ID: 21774780119
- Different job IDs: 62829359888 vs 62829359897
- PR #8 referenced
- Step 5, line 1369 in second job

## Job Matrix
The CI has multiple jobs for different platforms:
- aarch64-linux
- armhf-linux  
- i686-linux
- i686-win
- x86_64-linux-dbg
- x86_64-linux-nowallet
- x86_64-macos
- x86_64-win
- x86_64-win-experimental
- x86_64-linux-experimental
- aarch64-linux-experimental

Two different job IDs suggest two different matrix jobs failed.

## Most Likely Scenario
Given the Qt 6 upgrade, the jobs that build with Qt would fail if there's a configuration issue.
Jobs with NO_QT=1 or --disable-wallet should NOT be affected.

Jobs that WOULD be affected (use --with-gui=qt6):
- x86_64-linux-nowallet (line 105)
- x86_64-linux-dbg (line 119)
- i686-win (line 140)
- x86_64-win (line 159)
- x86_64-win-experimental (line 178)
- x86_64-macos (line 188)
- x86_64-linux-experimental (line 202)

## Action Items
1. All qt5 references were already updated to qt6 in ci.yml ✅
2. All Qt 6 configuration files are in place ✅
3. Workflow paths-ignore updated ✅
4. Need to verify no other issues

The failures should be resolved with the qt6 configuration fix already committed.
